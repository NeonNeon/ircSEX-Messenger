ircSEX Messenger
=========

The best Android irc client.

##Introduction
IRC or Internet Relay Chat is a messaging protocol for communication
with groups or individuals over the internet. It was created in 1988
and has been used ever since. Therefore there are a plethora of clients
with 20th century thinking. The demand for a new, 21st century client,
for 21st century devices is dire.

##Product vision
For IRC users who are using their Android phones to connect to IRC,
the ircSEX messenger is the client that will revolutionize the way we
communicate on mobile devices. Drawing upon modern messaging platforms
and idioms, with our product, we show that IRC can be more than a terminal
or look like a hacker chat. The world of IRC clients for Android is in dire
need for change - and weâ€™re here to do it!
